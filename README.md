TwitterDataAnalysis
===================

Analysis of the pain-related tweets mined from twitter. We will publish journal articles with the results.

This repository contains the machinery for analyzing the tweets mined from Twitter. 
The machinery for downloading and storing the tweets is handled in a separate repository ( [PainNarrativesLab/TwitterMining](https://github.com/PainNarrativesLab/TwitterMining)).

Please see the [project wiki](https://github.com/PainNarrativesLab/TwitterDataAnalysis/wiki) for details.

PainNarrativesLab is a project for California State University, Northridge students to learn programming and data analysis skills while collaborating with faculty on articles for scholarly journals.

#Please note that this repository is still being organized and not yet ready for public consumption!
