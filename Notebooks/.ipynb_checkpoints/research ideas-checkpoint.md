Perhaps look at words used to complain about pain "It hurts! Owwww" and their 
freq (maybe tf-idf) in different groups of users tweets


Remember: Having users who haven't tweeted doesn't mean that they are bots. We were also searching for user descriptions. We can still ask questions like 'Do people who mention migraine interestingly differ from people who mention fibro?' even if we have to query twitter for their tweets


# Project: Can we reliably pick out pain patients
- Perhaps one criteria could be whether their profiles involve pain and their tweets contain tweets about pain experience. 
- Then some machine learning could help us pick out pain patients who don't have pain in their profiles
